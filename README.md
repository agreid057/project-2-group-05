Our project focuses on building an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for Excel data. We extracted data from Excel files, then transformed the data using Pandas and regular expressions, next we exported the transformed data as CSV files. After the creation of the CSV files we created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the transformed data and loaded the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database using python. Finally, we performed various queries on the database and created visualizations based on the query results.

##### Project Steps-

Extraction: We extracted data from Excel files using Python and Pandas.  
Transformation: The data was transformed using Pandas and regular expressions to clean, filter, and aggregate the data.  
Export: The transformed data was exported as 4 CSV files for further processing.  
ERD Creation: Based on the transformed data, we created an Entity Relationship Diagram to visualize the database schema.  
Database Loading: The CSV files were loaded into a PostgreSQL database for querying and analysis using python.  
Queries: Several queries were performed on the database to extract meaningful insights from the data.  
Visualization: Visualizations were created based on the query results to present the data in a more understandable format.
